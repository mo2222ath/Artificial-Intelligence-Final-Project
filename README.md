# Artificial-Intelligence-Final-Project
Topic(A) It is required to provide different types of problem solving methods and solve a travel agent as search problem.


It is difficult to plan a travel from one city to another city when you are required to use more than one flight, you have to select and arrange the departure and arrival time for every flight in order to minimize the time between each flight and the next so that the total travel time is minimum. The project aims to solve this problem by creating a useful tool to solve the flights search problem, using A* search algorithms.
In other words, you are required to write a program that finds the best flights to reach one city from another city. Given a start city, end city and travel day the system will determine the best way to go from one city to another that minimizes the time. The result will be the travel plan that is a complete list of flights that a user must use between a series of cities to get from a starting city to a destination city.
